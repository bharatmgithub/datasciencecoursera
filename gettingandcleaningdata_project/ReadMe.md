###Getting and Cleaning Data Project

##Information

The repository contains the files of the class project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.A full description of the data used in this project can be found at The UCI Machine Learning Repository


## Project

The code run_analysis.R executes the following steps:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The end result is shown in the file tidy_data.txt and is uploaded.
